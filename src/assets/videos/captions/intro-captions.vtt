00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
Your mental, physical, and emotional

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.640
health are all related to how well

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.000
balanced your nervous system is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.380
Your nervous system is the neural highway

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.070
that connects your mind, body, and spirit,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.020
so how you feel is directly related to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.000
the system.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.990
And breathwork is the most effective way

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.000
of engaging this system.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.030
I'm Ronan O'Brien, founder of Breathwave

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.570
of Ireland, and I have developed a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.990
community-centered platform that helps

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.640
you access and engage your breath as a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.000
practice.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.390
My promise to you is, the results you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.630
feel from your practice will far outweigh

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.000
the time you spend in practice.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.660
