In April of this year, our CE4RT (Circular Economy for Regenerative Tourism) group embarked on a remarkable journey, traveling from the stunning Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland, all the way to Iceland. This international group, composed of passionate sustainability advocates from The Netherlands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Poland, gathered to explore the vital concepts of Regenerative Tourism and Sustainability.

The trip was an eye-opening experience, as we delved into innovative practices and thought-provoking discussions around how tourism can be a positive force for local communities and the environment. Iceland, with its unique landscapes and commitment to eco-conscious living, offered the perfect backdrop for learning. From geothermal energy to responsible tourism initiatives, we saw firsthand how the country balances its booming tourism industry with the preservation of nature. Our group exchanged ideas, shared experiences, and gained inspiration for how we can all do our part to nurture a more sustainable future for tourism.

The trip’s focus on Regenerative Tourism—an approach that goes beyond sustainability by aiming to actively improve and regenerate local ecosystems, communities, and economies—left a lasting impact on all who participated. We discovered that tourism can be a catalyst for good, helping to restore biodiversity, support local businesses, and create lasting positive change for generations to come.

Now, we’re beyond excited to welcome our CE4RT friends back to the Dingle Peninsula this November for a special conference dedicated to Regenerative Tourism. This time, the Dingle Peninsula itself will be the focal point as we gather to share what we’ve learned, continue our discussions, and work together to implement practical, regenerative strategies in our own regions.

As the stunning landscapes of the Dingle Peninsula provide the backdrop for this important event, we look forward to hosting colleagues and friends from across Europe for this collaborative exchange. Together, we will explore how we can create a tourism model that not only minimizes harm but actively contributes to the healing and regeneration of our beautiful environments and communities.

The upcoming conference will feature insightful talks, workshops, and hands-on activities focused on sustainable travel, conservation, and how local cultures can thrive through responsible tourism practices. It’s a wonderful opportunity for everyone involved to share knowledge, build connections, and shape the future of tourism in a way that’s not only sustainable but truly regenerative.

We’re incredibly proud to be part of this global movement and to play a role in making the Dingle Peninsula a beacon for regenerative tourism. We can’t wait to share the lessons learned from our Iceland adventure and work alongside our amazing CE4RT partners to create lasting, positive change for the world of travel.
