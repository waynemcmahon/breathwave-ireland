        content: `I first discovered Ronan's breathwork practice upon trying to "fix" the possible physical side to breathing. Believing that the mechanistic side to breathing was a source of a physical discomfort, ache, pain or movement dysfunction felt within the body. What I discovered through the consistent practice of "letting go" to the breath was profound. Our breath connects the physical, emotional and spiritual. Through a deeper engagement with my breath I started to realise and understand how our physical, emotional and spiritual sides are not separate. In essence trying to separate ourselves into "parts" leads to unresolved or only partly solves. Not only has Breathwave helped in my own life but it deepened my understanding of the "work" I do with my athletes.

Breathwork for me every week is a chance to reset. To change the narrative. A chance to disengage with the thoughts that entangle my reality. I can honestly say that the practice of breathwork has changed my relationship with myself, my interactions with others as well as my ability to process thoughts and emotions, making sense of the long-held stories and dogma.

I think everyone needs a practice to connect with themselves, especially with all the busyness and madness that we experience. Ronan's ability to create this unique space through his use of music, story and dialogue is what makes this more than just "breathing."`,

The beauty of this work is not that we won't have bad/ difficult days, but it is my ability to bounce back faster and faster each time. To always come back to myself. I am today, after recent issues surprisingly back to my peace, to myself. I'm calm, i'm able to think and see the road ahead. Thank you so much for the quality and honesty that your sessions allow for me, it was what I needed to remind myself of my worth. I appreciate and thank you üôèüèº`,
